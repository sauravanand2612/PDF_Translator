HISTORY OF UNIVERSITY OF PAVIA
825 and 1361: these two dates mark the beginning of the University of Pavia, the oldest
university in Lombardy and one of the oldest in Europe. The year 825 saw the emperor Lothair's
capitulary, which established in Pavia a school of rhetoric for the kingdom's officials; the
Studium Generale, instead, was founded by Charles IV in 1361: a renowned legal and literary
school that a􀆩racted students from all over Europe.
Among the periods of greatest fame of the University of Pavia is the 18th century, with the
radical reform by Maria Theresa and Joseph II of Habsburg. Many famous professors
contributed to its pres􀆟ge, from the naturalist Lazzaro Spallanzani, to the mathema􀆟cian
Gerolamo Cardano universally known for his contribu􀆟ons to algebra and mechanics (the
Cardan joint), to the mathema􀆟cian Lorenzo Mascheroni, to the physicist Alessandro Volta, who
was a professor of Experimental Physics, Rector of the University, and inventor of the electric
ba􀆩ery, to the physician Antonio Scarpa, ini􀆟ator of modern surgery. Among the great masters
of the Napoleonic era were Vincenzo Mon􀆟 and Ugo Foscolo, who in 1809 delivered the famous
lecture "On the Origin and Du􀆟es of Literature" in Pavia. Many illustrious doctors emerged from
the University of Pavia, such as Carlo Forlanini, inventor of pneumothorax for the treatment of
pulmonary tuberculosis, and Camillo Golgi, Nobel Prize winner in Medicine in 1906. Alongside
Golgi, two other professors from the University of Pavia have been awarded the Nobel Prize: the
chemist Giulio Na􀆩a and the physicist Carlo Rubbia.
Today, the Alma Ticinensis Universitas of Pavia offers, in its two campuses in Pavia and Cremona,
2 facul􀆟es, 18 departments, and 85 degree courses. It posi􀆟ons itself as a Research University,
par􀆟cipates in interna􀆟onal projects, and is part of work networks with major colleges
